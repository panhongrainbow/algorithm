# Mode 2 : Pool-Based Boundary Testing

## Introduction

This document introduces a pool-based testing model for B Plus Trees.

By combining fixed-capacity pools with repeated insertion and deletion cycles, the method naturally creates boundary conditions.

These scenarios expose hidden flaws, ensuring stability and consistency under long-term, high-pressure operations.

## Test Process

### Create the Pool

- Create a pool with fixed capacity.
- Ensure that at any given time there are no duplicate values inside the pool (historical repetition is allowed).

### Synchronous Insertion

- Insert a sequence of values into both the pool and the B Plus Tree simultaneously.
- Some of these values may cause B Plus Tree node splits and generate new index keys.

## Synchronous Deletion

- Delete a portion of values from both the pool and the B Plus Tree.
- Note : In a B Plus Tree, after deleting a data entry, the corresponding index key may not disappear immediately, and might temporarily remain (due to partial release).

## Random Reinsertion

- Generate new values to insert using randomness; these values may be identical to previously deleted ones.
- When these old values are reinserted, the B Plus Tree will attempt to relocate the index within the existing structure, creating a test scenario of index–data overlap / boundary conditions.

    participant T as Test Driver
    participant P as Pool (Fixed Capacity)
    participant B as B+Tree (Index)

    T->>P: 1) Create pool (no duplicates at the same time)
    T->>B: Initialize

    T->>P: 2) Batch insert values
    T->>B: 2) Synchronous insert values (may cause split/new index)
    Note over B: Some keys trigger node splits and creation of new index keys

    T->>P: 3) Batch delete subset
    T->>B: 3) Synchronously delete corresponding keys
    Note over B: Index keys may not disappear immediately

    T->>T: 4) Generate random candidates
    T->>P: 4) Reinsert candidates
    T->>B: 4) Synchronous reinsertion (Some historically deleted keys are reinserted)
    Note over B: Creates index–data overlap / boundary conditions

    T-->>T: Repeat steps 2–4 to amplify low-probability errors
